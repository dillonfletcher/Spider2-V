Snowsight loads your file and displays the number of rows successfully inserted into the table.
Create a table when loading a file
¶
You can create a new table when loading a file by taking the following steps.
Note
This feature supports delimited files, JSON, Parquet, Avro, and ORC files. It doesn’t support XML files.
To perform the tasks below, you must have the
privileges for creating table
.
Sign in to Snowsight.
In the navigation menu, select
Create
»
Table
»
From File
.
The
Load Data into Table
dialog appears.
In the
Load Data into Table
dialog, select or create a database and schema where you want the table to be created. Then select
Browse
to add a file, or
Drag and drop to upload files
, or
Add from stage
.
Enter a name for the new table and then select
Next
.
Snowsight detects the metadata schema for the file and returns the file format and column definitions identified by the
INFER_SCHEMA
function.
Review the inferred file format, data type, column name, and a sample of column data. Ensure all information is accurate and make updates if needed.
Select
Load
.
Snowsight loads the file and creates a new table for the file.
Loading data using Classic Console
¶
The Classic Console provides a wizard for loading limited amounts of data into a table from a small set of files.
The wizard performs the same PUT and COPY operations that you would using SQL, but combines the two phases (staging files and loading data)
into a single operation and deleting all staged files after the load completes.
You can load data from files on your local machine or files already staged in an existing cloud storage location on Snowflake, Amazon S3,
Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure.
Prerequisites for loading data
¶
Before you start loading data using Classic Console, do the following:
Identify the location your data files. You can load data from one of the following:
Your local machine.
An internal or external stage.

Load a file from a stage into an existing table
¶
Before loading files from a stage into a table, you need to create a stage and upload files onto the stage. For instructions, see
Staging files using Snowsight
.
Sign in to Snowsight.
In the object explorer, select the stage that you want to load files from.
In the list of the files on the stage, select the file that you want to load into the table.
In the ellipsis dropdown menu of the selected file, select
Load into table
.
In the
Load Data into Table
dialog, select a database, schema, and a table where you want to load the file.
Select
Next
.
Do one of the following:
Select a
file format
from the current database.
Select a file type to customize, and then select the relevant settings for your data file.
(Optional) Select what should happen if an error occurs during loading. By default, no data is loaded from the file.
Select
Load
.
Snowsight loads your file from the stage to the table.
Alternatively, you can load a staged file into a table by copying the path of the staged file.
Follow steps 1-3 in the previous procedure.
In the ellipsis dropdown menu of the selected file on the stage, select
Copy path
.
In the navigation menu, select
Data
»
Add Data
.
On the
Add Data
page, select
Load files into a Stage
.
In the object explorer, select the table that you want to load data into.
Select
Load Data
.
In the
Load Data into Table
dialog that appears, select
Add from Stage
.
Paste the path that you copied into the path field, and then select
Add
.
The staged file name appears.
Select
Next
.
Do one of the following:
Select a
file format
from the current database.
Select a file type to customize, and then select the relevant settings for your data file.

Bulk Loading from a Local File System
Tutorial: Bulk loading from a local file system using COPY
¶
This tutorial describes how to load data from files in your local file system into a table.
Introduction
¶
In this tutorial, you will learn how to:
Create named file format objects that describe your data files.
Create named stage objects.
Upload your data to the internal stages.
Load your data into tables.
Resolve errors in your data files.
The tutorial covers loading of both CSV and JSON data.
Prerequisites
¶
The tutorial assumes the following:
You have a Snowflake account and a user with a role that grants the necessary
privileges to create a database, tables, and virtual warehouse objects.
You have SnowSQL installed.
The
Snowflake in 20 minutes
tutorial provides the related step-by-step instructions to meet these requirements.
In addition, you need to do the following before you start the tutorial:
Download sample files provided for this exercise.
Create a database, tables, and a virtual warehouse for this tutorial.
These are the basic Snowflake objects needed for most Snowflake activities.
Downloading the sample data files
¶
For this tutorial you need to download the sample data files provided by Snowflake.
To download and unzip the sample data files:
Right-click the name of the
archive file,
data-load-internal.zip
and save the link/file to your local file system.
Unzip the sample files. The tutorial assumes you unpacked files in
to the following directories:
Linux/macOS:
/tmp/load
Windows:
C:\tempload
These data files include sample contact data in the following formats:
CSV files that contain a header row and five records. The field
delimiter is the pipe (
|
) character.

Copy
Reloading files
¶
Add
FORCE
=
TRUE
to a COPY command to reload (duplicate) data from a set of staged data files that have not changed (i.e. have
the same checksum as when they were first loaded).
