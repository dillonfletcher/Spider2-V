With a worksheet, you can do any of the following:</p><ul><p>Run ad hoc queries and other DDL/DML operations.</p><p>Write Snowpark Python code in a Python worksheet.</p><p>Review the query history and results of queries that you executed.</p><p>Examine multiple worksheets, each with its own separate session.</p><p>Export the results for a selected statement, while results are still available.</p></ul><img/><p>For more details, see:</p><ul><span>Getting started with worksheets</span><span>Managing and using worksheets in Snowsight</span><span>Querying data using worksheets</span><span>Writing Snowpark Code in Python Worksheets</span></ul></section><section><h2>Visualize query results with charts and dashboards<a>¶</a></h2><p>When you run a query in Snowsight, you can choose to view your results as a chart. You can also create a collection of charts
as a <span>Dashboard</span>, allowing you to review your data more easily. Dashboards provide flexible collections of charts arranged as tiles.
Dashboard charts start with SQL to generate results and associated charts. You can share these charts with others, modify the charts,
and display them as dashboard tiles.</p><img/><p>To learn more about charts, see <span>Visualizing worksheet data</span>.

Dashboards are flexible collections of charts arranged as tiles. The charts are generated by query results and can be customized.
You can also create dashboard tiles from charts in worksheets. For more details, see <span>Visualizing worksheet data</span>.</p><section><h2>Create a dashboard<a>¶</a></h2><p>You can create an empty dashboard or create a dashboard directly from a worksheet.</p><section><h3>Create an empty dashboard<a>¶</a></h3><p>To create an empty dashboard, complete the following steps:</p><ol><p>Sign in to Snowsight.</p><p>In the navigation menu, select <span>Projects</span>» <span>Dashboards</span>.</p><p>Select <span>+ Dashboard</span>.</p><li><p>Enter a name for the dashboard, and then select <span>Create Dashboard</span>.</p><p>The empty dashboard opens.</p></li></ol></section><section><h3>Create a dashboard from an existing worksheet<a>¶</a></h3><p>You can also use an existing worksheet to create a dashboard.</p><p>When you use a worksheet to create a dashboard, the worksheet is removed from the list of worksheets and can only be accessed from
the dashboard.

with randomly generated values.</p></div><p>You can use Snowsight to visualize the results of queries like this one, and get a
better sense of the smoothing effect of calculations with sliding window frames.
In the query worksheet, click the <span>Chart</span>button next to <span>Results</span>.</p><p>For example, the yellow line in the bar chart shows a much smoother trend for average
temperature versus the blue line for the raw temperature.</p><img/><p>Other window functions, such as the
<span>LEAD</span>and <span>LAG</span>ranking functions,
are also commonly used in time-series analysis. Use the LEAD window function to find the next data point in the time series,
relative to the current data point, and the LAG function to find the previous data point.</p></section><section><h3>Using the MIN_BY and MAX_BY aggregate functions<a>¶</a></h3><p>The ability to select one column based on the minimum or maximum value of another column in the
same row is a common requirement for SQL developers who are working with time-series data.
