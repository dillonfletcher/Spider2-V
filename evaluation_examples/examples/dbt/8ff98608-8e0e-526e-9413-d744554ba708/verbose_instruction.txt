In this task, you need to complete the declaration of a model and build it from scratch.

1. Run ``dbt debug`` to connect database.
2. Run ``dbt seed`` to load the seeds ``raw_customers`` and ``raw_orders`` used in the model ``customers.sql``.
3. Paste the following sql codes to select required columns.
```sql
customers.customer_id,
customers.first_name,
customers.last_name,
customer_orders.first_order_date,
customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders
```
4. Run ``dbt run`` to execute the model.
