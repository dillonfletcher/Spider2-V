This is a common dbt-core initialization task. To complete this, you need to:
1. Initiate the ``jaffle_shop`` project running ``dbt init jaffle_shop``, and choose duckdb as the database.
2. Unzip ``jaffle-shop-data.zip`` and move the seeds to /jaffle_shop/seeds.
```
unzip jaffle-shop-data.zip
mv jaffle-shop-data/* jaffle_shop/seeds
```
3. Edit ``~/.dbt.profiles.yml`` so that the paths for both dev and prod projects are set to ``jaffle_shop.duckdb``.
4. Run ``cd jaffle_shop`` to navigate into the project directory.
5. Run ``dbt debug`` to connect to the database at jaffle_shop.duckdb.
6. Run ``dbt seed`` to load the seeds.
