Exploring Data in Superset | Superset

Documentation Content:
The following section
explains how to enable this functionality for the examples database.</p><p>In the top menu, select <strong>Data ‣ Databases</strong>. Find the <strong>examples</strong>database in the list and
select the <strong>Edit</strong>button.</p><img/><p>In the resulting modal window, switch to the <strong>Extra</strong>tab and
tick the checkbox for <strong>Allow Data Upload</strong>. End by clicking the <strong>Save</strong>button.</p><img/><h3>Loading CSV Data<a>​</a></h3><p>Download the CSV dataset to your computer from
<a>GitHub</a>.
In the Superset menu, select <strong>Data ‣ Upload a CSV</strong>.</p><img/><p>Then, enter the <strong>Table Name</strong>as <em>tutorial_flights</em>and select the CSV file from your computer.</p><img/><p>Next enter the text <em>Travel Date</em>into the <strong>Parse Dates</strong>field.</p><img/><p>Leaving all the other options in their default settings, select <strong>Save</strong>at the bottom of the page.</p><h3>Table Visualization<a>​</a></h3><p>You should now see <em>tutorial_flights</em>as a dataset in the <strong>Datasets</strong>tab. Click on the entry to
launch an Explore workflow using this dataset.</p><p>In this section, we'll create a table visualization
to show the number of flights and cost per travel class.</p><p>By default, Apache Superset only shows the last week of data. In our example, we want to visualize all
of the data in the dataset. Click the <strong>Time ‣ Time Range</strong>section and change
the <strong>Range Type</strong>to <strong>No Filter</strong>.</p><img/><p>Click <strong>Apply</strong>to save.</p><p>Now, we want to specify the rows in our table by using the <strong>Group by</strong>option.

FAQ | Superset

Documentation Content:
Read the instructions <a>here</a>to learn
how to enable and use CSV upload.</p><h2>Why are my queries timing out?<a>​</a></h2><p>There are many possible causes for why a long-running query might time out.</p><p>For running long query from Sql Lab, by default Superset allows it run as long as 6 hours before it
being killed by celery. If you want to increase the time for running query, you can specify the
timeout in configuration. For example:</p><span>SQLLAB_ASYNC_TIME_LIMIT_SEC = 60 * 60 * 6</span><p>If you are seeing timeouts (504 Gateway Time-out) when loading dashboard or explore slice, you are
probably behind gateway or proxy server (such as Nginx). If it did not receive a timely response
from Superset server (which is processing long queries), these web servers will send 504 status code
to clients directly. Superset has a client-side timeout limit to address this issue. If query didn’t
come back within client-side timeout (60 seconds by default), Superset will display warning message
to avoid gateway timeout message. If you have a longer gateway timeout limit, you can change the
timeout settings in <strong>superset_config.py</strong>:</p><span>SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_TIMEOUT = 60</span><h2>Why is the map not visible in the geospatial visualization?<a>​</a></h2><p>You need to register a free account at <a>Mapbox.com</a>, obtain an API key, and add it
to <strong>.env</strong>at the key MAPBOX_API_KEY:</p><span>MAPBOX_API_KEY = "longstringofalphanumer1c"</span><h2>How to limit the timed refresh on a dashboard?<a>​</a></h2><p>By default, the dashboard timed refresh feature allows you to automatically re-query every slice on
a dashboard according to a set schedule. Sometimes, however, you won’t want all of the slices to be
refreshed - especially if some data is slow moving, or run heavy queries.

].schema].table name"</span><span>;</span></span><p>For example:</p><span><span>SELECT</span><span>*</span><span>FROM</span><span>"examples.birth_names"</span><span>;</span></span><p>Spaces are allowed, but periods in the names must be replaced by <code>%2E</code>. Eg:</p><span><span>SELECT</span><span>*</span><span>FROM</span><span>"Superset meta database.examples%2Ebirth_names"</span><span>;</span></span><p>The query above returns the same rows as <code>SELECT * FROM "examples.birth_names"</code>, and also shows that the meta database can query tables from any table — even itself!</p><h4>Considerations<a>​</a></h4><p>Before enabling this feature, there are a few considerations that you should have in mind. First, the meta database enforces permissions on the queried tables, so users should only have access via the database to tables that they originally have access to. Nevertheless, the meta database is a new surface for potential attacks, and bugs could allow users to see data they should not.</p><p>Second, there are performance considerations. The meta database will push any filtering, sorting, and limiting to the underlying databases, but any aggregations and joins will happen in memory in the process running the query. Because of this, it's recommended to run the database in async mode, so queries are executed in Celery workers, instead of the web workers. Additionally, it's possible to specify a hard limit on how many rows are returned from the underlying databases.</p><h4>Enabling the meta database<a>​</a></h4><p>To enable the Superset meta database, first you need to set the <code>ENABLE_SUPERSET_META_DB</code>feature flag to true. Then, add a new database of type "Superset meta database" with the SQLAlchemy URI "superset://".</p><p>If you enable DML in the meta database users will be able to run DML queries on underlying databases <strong>as long as DML is also enabled in them</strong>.

Creating Your First Dashboard | Superset

Documentation Content:
You’ll also explore the data you’ve exposed and add a visualization to a dashboard so that you get a
feel for the end-to-end user experience.</p><h3>Connecting to a new database<a>​</a></h3><p>Superset itself doesn't have a storage layer to store your data but instead pairs with
your existing SQL-speaking database or data store.</p><p>First things first, we need to add the connection credentials to your database to be able
to query and visualize data from it. If you're using Superset locally via
<a>Docker compose</a>, you can
skip this step because a Postgres database, named <strong>examples</strong>, is included and
pre-configured in Superset for you.</p><p>Under the <strong>+</strong>menu in the top right, select Data, and then the <em>Connect Database</em>option:</p><img/><p>Then select your database type in the resulting modal:</p><img/><p>Once you've selected a database, you can configure a number of advanced options in this window,
or for the purposes of this walkthrough, you can click the link below all these fields:</p><img/><p>Once you've clicked that link you only need to specify two things (the database name and SQLAlchemy URI):</p><img/><p>As noted in the text below the form, you should refer to the SQLAlchemy documentation on
<a>creating new connection URIs</a>for your target database.</p><p>Click the <strong>Test Connection</strong>button to confirm things work end to end.
