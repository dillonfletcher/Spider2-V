Alerts and Reports | Superset

You may get different responses depending on whether the dashboard exists - for example, you may need to change the <code>1</code>in that URL. If there's a URL in your logs from a failed report screenshot, that's a good place to start. The goal is to determine a valid value for <code>WEBDRIVER_BASEURL</code>and determine if an issue like HTTPS or authentication is redirecting your worker.</p><p>In a deployment with authentication measures enabled like HTTPS and Single Sign-On, it may make sense to have the worker navigate directly to the Superset application running in the same location, avoiding the need to sign in.  For instance, you could use <code>WEBDRIVER_BASEURL="http://superset_app:8088"</code>for a docker compose deployment, and set <code>"force_https": False,</code>in your <code>TALISMAN_CONFIG</code>.</p><h2>Scheduling Queries as Reports<a>​</a></h2><p>You can optionally allow your users to schedule queries directly in SQL Lab. This is done by adding
extra metadata to saved queries, which are then picked up by an external scheduled (like
<a>Apache Airflow</a>).</p><p>To allow scheduled queries, add the following to <code>SCHEDULED_QUERIES</code>in your configuration file:</p><code><span><span>SCHEDULED_QUERIES </span><span>=</span><span>{</span></span><span># This information is collected when the user clicks "Schedule query",</span><span># and saved into the `extra` field of saved queries.</span><span># See: https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form</span><span><span>'JSONSCHEMA'</span><span>:</span><span>{</span></span><span><span>'title'</span><span>:</span><span>'Schedule'</span><span>,</span></span><span><span>'description'</span><span>:</span><span>(</span></span><span>'In order to schedule a query, you need to specify when it '</span><span>'should start running, when it should stop running, and how '</span><span>'often it should run.
