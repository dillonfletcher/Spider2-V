I want to migrate a DAG from Airflow to Dagster. To do this:
1. Open the file "README.md" from the navbar in VS Code.
2. Check connection information to the MySQL server.
3. Open "dagster_migration.py". Add the following code:
```
import os

from airflow.models import Connection
from dagster_airflow import (
    make_dagster_definitions_from_airflow_dags_path,
)

migrated_airflow_definitions = make_dagster_definitions_from_airflow_dags_path(
    os.path.abspath("./dags/"),
    connections=[
        Connection(conn_id="mysql_conn", conn_type="mysql", description="MySQL connection", host="localhost", login="user", password="password", port=3306)
    ]
)
```
4. Open the terminal. Make sure you are in the directory "~/wikipediaPageViews".
5. Start the Dagster UI by the command "dagster dev -f dagster_migration.py".
6. Go to Chromium. Enter address "localhost:3000" in the address bar.
7. Click "Deployment" on the top.
8. Click "dagster_migration.py" on the left of the table.
9. Click "Schedules" in the middle.
10. In the table, set the toggle button on under "Running" to start the schedule.
11. To test the scheduel, click "wikipediaPageViews_schedule" in the table.
12. Click "Test Schedule" on the top-right of the page.
13. A pop-up window will show up. Click "Evaluate" on the bottom-right of the pop-up window.
14. Click "Open in Launchpad" right of the table.
15. Click "Launch run" on the bottom-right of the newly opened page. Wait for the run to complete. Try to debug if the run fails.
