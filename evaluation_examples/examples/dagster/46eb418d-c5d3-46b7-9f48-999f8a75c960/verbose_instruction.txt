Build a sensor "directory_sensor" that watches for file creation in the directory "/home/user/file-watch-sensor/files". When there is a new file created in that directory, launch the job "log_file_job" to output its filename. Start the sensor in the UI.
To achieve this:
1. Switch to VS Code and open the folder file_watch_sensor.
2. Create a new file "directory_sensor.py" and add the following code:
```
import os
from dagster import sensor, RunRequest, RunConfig
from .log_file_job import log_file_job, FileConfig

@sensor(job=log_file_job, minimum_interval_seconds=3)
def directory_sensor():
    for filename in os.listdir("/home/user/file-watch-sensor/files/"):
        filepath = os.path.join("/home/user/file-watch-sensor/files/", filename)
        if os.path.isfile(filepath):
            yield RunRequest(
                run_key=filename,
                run_config=RunConfig(
                    ops={"process_file": FileConfig(filename=filename)}
                ),
            )
```
3. In "__init__.py" in the directory "file_watch_sensor", update the code to include the sensor in the definitions:
```
from dagster import Definitions, load_assets_from_modules

from . import assets, log_file_job
from .directory_sensor import directory_sensor

all_assets = load_assets_from_modules([assets])

defs = Definitions(
    assets=all_assets,
    sensors=[directory_sensor]
)
```
4. Switch to Chromium and open the Dagster UI.
5. Click "Reload" on the right of the page in the "Deployment" tab of the UI.
6. Click "file_watch_sensor" on the left to enter the module containing the sensor
7. Navigate to the "Sensors" tab, and click the "directory_sensor" in the table below
8. On the left of the sensor page, Set "Running" to ON.
