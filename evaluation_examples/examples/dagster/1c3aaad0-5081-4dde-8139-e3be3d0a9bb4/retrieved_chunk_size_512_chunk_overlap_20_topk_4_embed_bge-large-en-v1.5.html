Documentation Content:
The UI provides multiple views that help with observing sensor evaluations, skip reasons, and errors.</p><p>To view all sensors, navigate to <strong>Overview &gt; Sensors</strong>. Here, you can start and stop sensors, and view their frequency, last tick, and last run:</p><img/><p>Click on any sensor to <a>test the sensor</a>, monitor all sensor evaluations on a timeline, and view a table of runs launched by the sensor.</p><h2>Run status sensors<span>#</span></h2><p>If you want to act on the status of a job run, Dagster provides a way to create a sensor that reacts to run statuses. You can use <code>run_status_sensor</code>with a specified <code>DagsterRunStatus</code>to decorate a function that will run when the given status occurs.

</p><p>Note also that in the example above, both a <code>run_key</code><em>and</em>cursor are being used. This means that if the cursor is reset but the target files don't change, new runs will not be launched because the run keys have not changed. If you want the ability to fully reset the state of your sensor by resetting the cursor, then you should not set <code>run_key</code>on <code>RunRequest</code>.</p><h2>Evaluation interval<span>#</span></h2><p>By default, the Dagster daemon runs a sensor 30 seconds after that sensor's previous evaluation finishes executing. You can configure the interval using the <code>minimum_interval_seconds</code>argument on the <code>@sensor</code>decorator.</p><p>It's important to note that this interval represents a minimum interval between runs of the sensor and not the exact frequency the sensor runs. If you have a sensor that takes 30 seconds to complete, but the <code>minimum_interval_seconds</code>is <code>5</code>seconds, the fastest Dagster daemon will run the sensor is every 35 seconds.
