I have a dagster asset "iris_dataset". Please create another asset that creates a table in duckdb which creates a table called "iris_virginica" that extracts all entries with species "Iris-virginica". To do this, the steps are:
1. Go to VS Code and open the folder "iris_analysis" in the left navbar.
2. Open the file "assets.py" and add the following asset definition to the end of the file:
```
@asset(deps=[iris_dataset])
def iris_virginica(duckdb: DuckDBResource) -> None:
    with duckdb.get_connection() as conn:
        conn.execute(
            "CREATE TABLE iris_virginica AS SELECT * FROM iris_dataset WHERE species = 'Iris-virginica'"
        )
```
3. Change to Chromium. Click "Reload definitions" at the top-right of the page.
4. After the asset "iris-virginica" is shown in the lineage graph, click "Materialize all" at the top-right of the graph. Wait for the materialization to finish.
