Documentation Title:
Using Dagster with dbt, part 2: Load dbt models as Dagster assets

Documentation Content:
Materializing an asset means running some computation to update its contents in persistent storage. In this tutorial, that persistent storage is our local DuckDB database.</p><p>To build your dbt project, i.e. materialize your assets, click the <strong>Materialize all</strong>button near the top right corner of the page. This will launch a run to materialize the assets. When finished, the <strong>Materialized</strong>and <strong>Latest Run</strong>attributes in the asset will be populated:</p><img/><p>After the run completes, you can:</p><ul><li>Click the <strong>asset</strong>to open a sidebar containing info about the asset, including its last materialization stats and a link to view the <a><strong>Asset details</strong>page</a></li><li>Click the ID of the <strong>Latest Run</strong>in an asset to view the <strong>Run details</strong>page. This page contains detailed info about the run, including timing information, errors, and logs.</li></ul><h2>Step 4: Understand the Python code in your Dagster project<span>#</span></h2><p>You saw how you can create a Dagster project that loads a dbt project. How does this work? Understanding how Dagster loads a dbt project will give you a foundation for customizing how Dagster runs your dbt project, as well as for connecting it to other data assets outside of dbt.</p><p>The most important file is the Python file that contains the set of definitions for Dagster to load: <code>jaffle_shop/definitions.py</code>. Dagster executes the code in this file to find out what assets it should be aware of, as well as details about those assets.
