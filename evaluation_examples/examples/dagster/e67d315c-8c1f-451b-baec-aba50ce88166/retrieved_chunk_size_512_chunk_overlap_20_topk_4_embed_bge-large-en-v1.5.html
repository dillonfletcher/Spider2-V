In this section, we'll walk you through setting up Dagster to oversee both the Airbyte and dbt workflows:</p><p><strong>Navigate to the Orchestration Directory</strong>:</p><p>Switch to the directory containing the Dagster orchestration configurations:</p><code>cd ../orchestration</code><p><strong>Set Environment Variables</strong>:</p><p>Dagster requires certain environment variables to be set to interact with other tools like dbt and Airbyte. Set the following variables:</p><code>export DAGSTER_DBT_PARSE_PROJECT_ON_LOAD=1
export AIRBYTE_PASSWORD=password</code><p>Note: The AIRBYTE_PASSWORD is set to password as a default for local Airbyte instances. If you've changed this during your Airbyte setup, ensure you use the appropriate password here.</p><p><strong>Launch the Dagster UI</strong>:</p><p>With the environment variables in place, kick-start the Dagster UI:</p><code>dagster dev</code><p><strong>Access Dagster in Your Browser</strong>:</p><p>Open your browser and navigate to <a>http://127.0.0.1:3000</a>. There, you should see assets for both Airbyte and dbt. To get an overview of how these assets interrelate, click on "view global asset lineage". This will give you a clear picture of the data lineage, visualizing how data flows between the tools.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>Once you've set up and launched this initial integration, the real power lies in its adaptability and extensibility. Here‚Äôs a roadmap to help you customize and harness this project tailored to your specific data needs:</p><p><strong>Add more Data(base) sources</strong>:</p><p>You can add more databases or data sources from Airbyte's <a>source catalogue</a>.

Check out the<a>Airbyte Cloud with Dagster guide</a>!</span><p>Dagster can orchestrate your Airbyte connections, making it easy to chain an Airbyte sync with upstream or downstream steps in your workflow.</p><p>This guide focuses on how to work with Airbyte connections using Dagster's <a>software-defined asset (SDA)</a>framework.</p><img/><h2>Airbyte connections and Dagster software-defined assets<span>#</span></h2><p>An <a>Airbyte connection</a>defines a series of data streams which are synced between a source and a destination. During a sync, a replica of the data from each data stream is written to the destination, typically as one or more tables. Dagster represents each of the replicas generated in the destination as a software-defined asset. This enables you to easily:</p><ul><li>Visualize the streams involved in an Airbyte connection and execute a sync from Dagster</li><li>Define downstream computations which depend on replicas produced by Airbyte</li><li>Track historical metadata and logs for each data stream</li><li>Track data lineage through Airbyte and other tools</li></ul><h2>Prerequisites<span>#</span></h2><p>To get started, you will need to install the <code>dagster</code>and <code>dagster-airbyte</code>Python packages:</p><code>pip <span>install</span>dagster dagster-airbyte
</code><p>You'll also want to have an Airbyte instance running. If you don't have one already, you can <a>run Airbyte locally using <code>docker-compose</code></a>.</p><h2>Step 1: Connecting to Airbyte<span>#</span></h2><p>The first step in using Airbyte with Dagster is to tell Dagster how to connect to your Airbyte instance using an Airbyte <a>resource</a>.

Launch the Dagster UI:</h3><p>With the environment variables in place, kick-start the Dagster UI:</p><code>dagster dev</code><h3>4. Access Dagster in Your Browser:</h3><p>Navigate to <a>http://127.0.0.1:3000</a>in your browser. Here, you'll see assets for both Airbyte and dbt. To understand how these assets are connected and how data flows between them, click on ‚ÄúView global asset lineage‚Äù in the Dagster UI. This visual representation of data lineage is invaluable for understanding and debugging the data pipeline.</p><figure><img/><figcaption>Dagster DAG, which hasn't been materialized</figcaption></figure><h3>5. Materialize Dagster Assets:</h3><p>In the Dagster UI, click on "Materialize all". This action triggers the entire data pipeline:</p><ul><li>First, the Airbyte sync will extract data from the Faker source and load it into BigQuery.</li><li>Following that, dbt will transform the raw data, materializing the &lt;span class="text-style-code"&gt;staging&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="text-style-code"&gt;marts&lt;/span&gt; models in BigQuery.</li></ul><figure><img/><figcaption>Dagster DAG, materialization in progress</figcaption></figure><h3>6. Verify the Workflow:</h3><ul><li>Visit the Airbyte UI to confirm that a sync is running.</li><li>After the dbt jobs have completed, check your BigQuery console to ensure the views have been created in the &lt;span class="text-style-code"&gt;transformed_data&lt;/span&gt; dataset.</li></ul><p>‚Äç</p><figure><img/><figcaption>Tables and views created in BigQuery</figcaption></figure><p>By following these steps, you'll have a fully functional data pipeline orchestrated by Dagster, efficiently managing data extraction, loading, and transformation processes. üéâ</p><h2>7.
