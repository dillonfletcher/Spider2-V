Help me test the sensor "math_sensor" with cursor value "123" in the opened dagster UI, with these steps:
1. Open Chromium to view the UI and click the "math_sensor" on the top of the page.
2. In the sensor page, click "Test Sensor" at the top-right.
3. Enter value "123" in the cursor field of the pop-up window, and then click "Evaluate" at the bottom-right.
4. You should see "1 run requests" as the result and a table with a job. Click the "Open in Launchpad" button in the table.
5. A new tab will open for you. Click the "Launch Run" button at the bottom-right. Then wait for the run to succeed.
