Tutorial, part three: Writing your first asset | Dagster Docs

Documentation Content:
As more assets are built, this graph will show your entire data platform in one place. This page can also be referred to as the <strong>Global Asset Lineage</strong>.</p><img/><p>Observe that Dagster has detected your <code>topstory_ids</code>asset, but it says that the asset has never been <em>“materialized”</em>.</p><h2>Step 2: Materialize your asset<span>#</span></h2><p>To <strong>materialize</strong>a Software-defined asset means to create or update it. Dagster materializes assets by executing the asset's function or triggering an integration.</p><p>To manually materialize an asset in the UI, click the <strong>Materialize</strong>button in the upper right corner of the screen. This will create a Dagster run that will materialize your assets.</p><p>To follow the progress of the materialization and monitor the logs, each run has a dedicated page. To find the page:</p><ol><p>Click on the <strong>Runs</strong>tab in the upper navigation bar</p><p>Click the value in the <strong>Run ID</strong>column on the table of the Runs page</p><li><p>The top section displays the progress, and the bottom section live updates with the logs</p><img/></li></ol><h2>Next steps<span>#</span></h2><p>You've written the first step in your data pipeline! In <a>the next section</a>, you'll learn how to add more assets to your pipeline.

From here, we can run our data pipeline.</p><p>To run the pipeline, click the <strong>Materialize All</strong>button in the top right. In Dagster, <em>materialization</em>refers to executing the code associated with an asset to produce an output.</p><img/><p>Congratulations! You have successfully materialized two Dagster assets:</p><img/><p>But wait - there's more. Because the <code>hackernews_top_stories</code>asset returned some <code>metadata</code>, you can view the metadata right in the UI:</p><ol><li>Click the asset</li><li>In the sidebar, click the <strong>Show Markdown</strong>link in the <strong>Materialization in Last Run</strong>section. This opens a preview of the pipeline result, allowing you to view the top 10 HackerNews stories:</li></ol><img/><h2>Understanding the Code<span>#</span></h2><p>The Quickstart project defines two <strong>Assets</strong>using the <code>@asset</code>decorator:</p><ul><li><code>hackernews_top_story_ids</code>retrieves the top stories from the Hacker News API and saves them as a JSON file.</li><li><code>hackernews_top_stories</code>asset builds upon the first asset, retrieving data for each story as a CSV file, and returns a <code>MaterializeResult</code>with a markdown preview of the top stories.</li></ul><code><span>import</span>json

This opens the <strong>Asset catalog</strong>:</p><img/></div></div><h3>Materializing assets in the UI<span>#</span></h3><p>In the UI, you can launch runs that materialize assets by:</p><ul><li>Navigating to the <a><strong>Asset details</strong>page</a>for the asset and clicking the <strong>Materialize</strong>button in the upper right corner.</li><li>Navigating to the graph view of the <a><strong>Asset catalog</strong>page</a>and clicking the <strong>Materialize</strong>button in the upper right corner. You can also click on individual assets to collect a subset to materialize.</li></ul><h2>Building jobs that materialize assets<span>#</span></h2><p>Jobs that target assets can materialize a fixed selection of assets each time they run and be placed on schedules and sensors. Refer to the <a>Asset jobs documentation</a>for more info and examples.</p><h2>Grouping assets<span>#</span></h2><p>To help keep your assets tidy, you can organize them into groups. Grouping assets by project, concept, and so on simplifies <a>keeping track of them in the UI</a>. Each asset is assigned to a single group, which by default is called "default".</p><ul><a>Assigning assets to groups</a><a>Viewing asset groups in the UI</a></ul><h3>Assigning assets to groups<span>#</span></h3><p>In Dagster, there are two ways to assign assets to groups:</p><ul><a>By specifying a group name on an individual asset</a><li><a>By using the <code>group_name</code>argument when calling <code>load_assets_from_package_module</code></a>(<strong>recommended</strong>)</li></ul><p>By default, assets that aren't assigned to a group will be placed in a group named <code>default</code>.

Documentation Title:
Auto-Materializing Assets | Dagster

Documentation Content:
This enables a declarative approach to asset scheduling – instead of defining imperative workflows to materialize your assets, you just describe the conditions under which they should be materialized.</p><p>At a high-level, the most common way for assets to be auto-materialized is "eagerly" -- immediately after upstream changes occur, a run will be kicked off to incorporate those changes into a given asset. However, the precise rules that govern when runs are kicked off can be customized on an asset-by-asset basis.</p><h2>Turning on auto-materializing<span>#</span></h2><p>To enable assets to be automatically materialized, you need to first flip a toggle in the Dagster UI.</p><ul><li>If you're using an open source Dagster deployment, you can get to this toggle by clicking "Deployment" in the top navigation pane and then clicking on the "Daemons" tab.</li><li>If you're using Dagster+, you can get to this toggle by clicking "Deployment" in the top navigation pane, then clicking on the "Agents" tab, then looking under "Cloud service statuses".</li></ul><h2>Auto-materialize policies<span>#</span></h2><p>You can set up an asset to be auto-materialized by assigning it an <code>AutoMaterializePolicy</code>. Each policy consists of a set of <code>AutoMaterializeRules</code>, each representing individual reasons that an asset should be materialized or not at a given point in time. If there's at least one rule determining that the asset should be materialized, and no rules determining that it should be skipped, a run will be launched to materialize that asset.</p><p>It is recommended to start with the built-in <code>AutoMaterializePolicy.eager</code>and further customize from there if necessary. This policy consists of all of the supported rules, other than <code>materialize_on_cron</code>and <code>skip_on_not_all_parents_updated</code>.
