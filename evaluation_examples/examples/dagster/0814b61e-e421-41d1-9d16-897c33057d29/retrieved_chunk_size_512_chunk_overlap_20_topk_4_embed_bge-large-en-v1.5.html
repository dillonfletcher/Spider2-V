Documentation Content:
As more assets are built, this graph will show your entire data platform in one place. This page can also be referred to as the <strong>Global Asset Lineage</strong>.</p><img/><p>Observe that Dagster has detected your <code>topstory_ids</code>asset, but it says that the asset has never been <em>“materialized”</em>.</p><h2>Step 2: Materialize your asset<span>#</span></h2><p>To <strong>materialize</strong>a Software-defined asset means to create or update it. Dagster materializes assets by executing the asset's function or triggering an integration.</p><p>To manually materialize an asset in the UI, click the <strong>Materialize</strong>button in the upper right corner of the screen. This will create a Dagster run that will materialize your assets.</p><p>To follow the progress of the materialization and monitor the logs, each run has a dedicated page. To find the page:</p><ol><p>Click on the <strong>Runs</strong>tab in the upper navigation bar</p><p>Click the value in the <strong>Run ID</strong>column on the table of the Runs page</p><li><p>The top section displays the progress, and the bottom section live updates with the logs</p><img/></li></ol><h2>Next steps<span>#</span></h2><p>You've written the first step in your data pipeline! In <a>the next section</a>, you'll learn how to add more assets to your pipeline.

This opens the <strong>Asset catalog</strong>:</p><img/></div></div><h3>Materializing assets in the UI<span>#</span></h3><p>In the UI, you can launch runs that materialize assets by:</p><ul><li>Navigating to the <a><strong>Asset details</strong>page</a>for the asset and clicking the <strong>Materialize</strong>button in the upper right corner.</li><li>Navigating to the graph view of the <a><strong>Asset catalog</strong>page</a>and clicking the <strong>Materialize</strong>button in the upper right corner. You can also click on individual assets to collect a subset to materialize.</li></ul><h2>Building jobs that materialize assets<span>#</span></h2><p>Jobs that target assets can materialize a fixed selection of assets each time they run and be placed on schedules and sensors. Refer to the <a>Asset jobs documentation</a>for more info and examples.</p><h2>Grouping assets<span>#</span></h2><p>To help keep your assets tidy, you can organize them into groups. Grouping assets by project, concept, and so on simplifies <a>keeping track of them in the UI</a>. Each asset is assigned to a single group, which by default is called "default".</p><ul><a>Assigning assets to groups</a><a>Viewing asset groups in the UI</a></ul><h3>Assigning assets to groups<span>#</span></h3><p>In Dagster, there are two ways to assign assets to groups:</p><ul><a>By specifying a group name on an individual asset</a><li><a>By using the <code>group_name</code>argument when calling <code>load_assets_from_package_module</code></a>(<strong>recommended</strong>)</li></ul><p>By default, assets that aren't assigned to a group will be placed in a group named <code>default</code>.
