After the Connection is built, read the README.md that has been opened in VSCode to get instructions on completing the custom_check.sql file.
Complete the DAG file ‘custom_check.sql’ that has been opened in VSCode
    To be specific, define a SQL to construct a filtering process 
Save it
After custom_check.sql is written, read the README.md opened in VSCode to obtain instructions on completing the SQL_Check.py file.
Complete the DAG file ‘SQL_Check.py’ that has been opened in VSCode 
    To be specific, define task_id and conn_id
    Then define the sql used for checking data quality
At last, save it
In the opened ‘/home/user/projects/SQL_Check’ terminal, enter ```astro dev restart`` to restart the UI
Find sql_data_quality in the DAG list on the Airflow web page and click the slider to the left of the name to Unpause dag
Click the triangle under the Action column on the far right to trigger dag
Wait for the status of all tasks in the Runs column to change to "success" or "failed"
Click sql_data_quality in the Dag column to enter the task details of the DAG.
