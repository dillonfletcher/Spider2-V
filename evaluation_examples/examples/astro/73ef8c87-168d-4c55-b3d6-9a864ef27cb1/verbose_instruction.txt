I am using Astronomer to place Airflow
Select Admin from the menu at the top of the Airflow web page
Click Connections
Click the blue plus sign below the Search bar to create a new Connection
The details of connection are as follows:
    connection id is http_weather_service, 
    connection type is HTTP, 
    host is 'wttr.in', 
    schema is 'https'
First fill in the Connection Type so that the Connection table displays the correct format.
Then fill in the remaining information
Finally, at the bottom of the web page, click the dark blue Save button to save the Connection
Find weather_data_dag in the DAG list on the Airflow web page and click the slider to the left of the name to Unpause dag
Click the triangle under the Action column on the far right to trigger dag
Wait for the status of all tasks in the Runs column to change to "success" or "failed"
