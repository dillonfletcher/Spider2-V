3) Click the "+ ADD" button next to the "Explorer" panel.
4) Click the "Local file" panel on the pop-up window.
5) In the input box "Select file", browse the local file system and select the file "yob2014.txt" on the desktop.
6) For file format, click and choose "CSV" in the drop-down panel.
7) For Destination, firstly click "CREATE NEW DATASET".
8) Type in "babynames" in the `Dataset ID` field and click button "CERATE DATASET".
9) For the `Table` field, type in text "names_2014".
10) As for the schema, click the button "+" to add field. Add these fields one-by-one:
Field name: name; Type: STRING
Field name: assigned_sex_at_birth; Type: STRING
