In this task, we will use VSCode to write code to query a public dataset `austin_bikeshare` and save the execution results into a local .csv file. Concretely,
1. Click "query.py" to see the project code. we can see the code is partially finished, and we need to know the detailed information of austin_bikeshare.
2. Change to Google Chrome, we can see the information of austin_bikeshare database.
3. Click "bikeshare_stations" to understand the table schema.
4. Click "preview" to see the sample data of bikeshare_stations, in order to write the correct SQL.
5. Change to VSCode, write the following code into the blank panel "query.py"
```
import os
import pandas as pd
from google.cloud import bigquery

def query_data():
    os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "credential.json"
    client = bigquery.Client()
    
    query = """
        SELECT name, (footprint_length * footprint_width) AS area
        FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
        ORDER BY area DESC
        LIMIT 10;
    """

    query_job = client.query(query)
    try:
      results = query_job.result().to_dataframe() 
      if results.empty:
        print("No data found for the specified query.")
      else:
        results.to_csv("result.csv", index=False)
        print("Results saved to result.csv")
    except Exception as e:
      print("Error occurred while fetching data: ", e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    query_data()
```
6. In the opened terminal, type in "python query.py" to run the code
