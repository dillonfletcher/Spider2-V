</span></devsite-feature-tooltip><div><h1>Managing jobs</h1><p>After you submit a BigQuery job, you can <a>view job details</a>,
<a>list jobs</a>, <a>cancel a job</a>, <a>repeat a
job</a>, or <a>delete job metadata</a>.</p><p>When a job is submitted, it can be in one of the following states:</p><ul><li><code>PENDING</code>: The job is scheduled and waiting to be run.</li><li><code>RUNNING</code>: The job is in progress.</li><li><code>DONE</code>: The job is completed. If the job completes without errors, then BigQuery reports this state as <code>SUCCESS</code>. If the job completes with errors, then BigQuery reports this state as <code>FAILURE</code>.</li></ul><h2>Before you begin</h2><p>Grant Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles that give users the necessary permissions to perform each task in this document. The permissions required to perform a task (if any) are listed in the "Required permissions" section of the task.</p><h2>View job details</h2><p>You can view job details by using the Google Cloud console, the
bq command-line tool, the API, or the client libraries. The details include data and
metadata, such as the job type, the job state, and the user who created the job.</p><h3>Required permissions</h3><p>To view job details, you need the <code>bigquery.jobs.get</code>IAM permission.
