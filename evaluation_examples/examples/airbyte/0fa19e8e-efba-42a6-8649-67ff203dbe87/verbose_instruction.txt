In this task, we want to use data-diff in terminal to check the difference of replicated data from Postgres to Snowflake in the user table: 
1. After waiting for the airbyte connection sync to complete (indicated by the icon turning into a green checkmark), switch the window to the terminal.
In the terminal, enter the following commands to update the source's database:
2. In the terminal, enter the following commands to update the source's database:
```docker exec -i airbyte-source psql -U postgres -d development -c "INSERT INTO customers.users(col1) VALUES('record4');```
and
```docker exec -i airbyte-source psql -U postgres -d development -c "INSERT INTO customers.users(col1) VALUES('record5');```
3. In the terminal, enter the data-diff command and record the result in the data_diff.csv file, which looks like this:
```data-diff DB1_URI TABLE1_NAME DB2_URI TABLE2_NAME >> diff_test.csv```
    (1)DB1_URI is in the form of "snowflake://[username]:[password]@[account]/[DATABASE]/[SCHEMA]?warehouse=[WAREHOUSE]&role=[ROLE]", and DB2 URI is in the format of "postgresql://[username]:[password]@localhost:5432/[database]". 
    (2)The Snowflake password is already provided in the desktop's config file, and other required information can be obtained from the airbyte connection's interactive interface. 
    (3)Note that [DATABASE], [SCHEMA], [WAREHOUSE], [ROLE], and TABLE_NAME for DB1 should be in uppercase, and TABLE2_NAME for DB2 should specify the schema.
