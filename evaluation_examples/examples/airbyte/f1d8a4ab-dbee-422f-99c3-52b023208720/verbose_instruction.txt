In this task, we want to change the data in the source database and sync the existing Airbyte connection to transport the new data to the destination. To complete this:
1. Switch to the terminal window;
2. Next, in the terminal, run the following command to retrieve the stream and save the file:
```
docker exec -i airbyte-source psql -U postgres <<EOF
UPDATE table_one SET name='Eg2b IncAp' WHERE id=2;
EOF
```
3. Switch to the Airbyte connections page, click the connection "incremental-sync-demo" under the title "Connections";
