For now, we only have the <em>cars</em>table. If you expand it, you can see the columns it has.</p><p>Now, you should select a <strong>sync mode</strong>. If you want to take full advantage of using Change Data Capture, you should use <em>Incremental | Append</em>mode to only look at the rows that have changed in the source and sync them to the destination.

Documentation Content:
Create a Postgres source called <strong>Postgres-source</strong>, as shown below: </p><img/></div><h2>Configure a Postgres destination</h2><div><p>To drive data into the Postgres database that you created earlier, you will first need to define a destination. Configure an Airbyte destination destination called <strong>Postgres-destination</strong>as follows:</p><img/></div><h2>Database synchronization with full refresh overwrite</h2><div><p>In this section you will create an <a>Airbyte connection</a>that reads data from the Postgres source and drives it into the Postgres destination using the <strong>full refresh | overwrite</strong>replication mode. In this mode, all data in the source database is sent to the destination database, regardless of whether it has been synced before or not. You can see this for yourself by following along the steps presented below.</p><h3>Create a full refresh overwrite connection</h3><p>Create a new connection that will be used for verifying the functionality of <strong>full refresh | overwrite</strong>synchronization. Select the <strong>Postgres-source</strong>source, which you previously defined, as the source for this connection.</p><img/><p>‍</p><p>And select <strong>Postgres-destination,</strong>which you previously defined, as the destination for this connection.</p><img/><p>‍</p><p>You will see a set up page as shown below. Set the name of the connection to <strong>full-refresh-overwrite</strong>, and the destination stream prefix as <strong>overwrite_</strong>as shown below.</p><p>‍</p><img/><p>‍</p><p>After you set up the connection, you should see that a first sync has automatically started.  Once it completes, you should see a message indicating that two records have been emitted as follows:</p><img/><p>.</p><h3>Open a Postgres terminal in the destination container</h3><p>‍</p><p>Now that the first sync has completed you can take a look at the Postgres destination to see how the replicated data looks.
