When viewing the Airbyte UI, you'll see the main navigation bar on the left side of your screen. Click the <strong>Sources</strong>tab to bring up a list of all available sources.</p><p>You can use the provided search bar, or simply scroll down the list to find the source you want to replicate data from. Let's use a demo source, Faker, as an example. Clicking on the <strong>Sample Data (Faker)</strong>card will bring us to its setup page.</p><img/><p>The left half of the page contains a set of fields that you will have to fill out. In the <strong>Source name</strong>field, you can enter a name of your choosing to help you identify this instance of the connector. By default, this will be set to the name of the source (ie, <code>Sample Data (Faker)</code>).</p><p>Each connector in Airbyte will have its own set of authentication methods and configurable parameters. In the case of Sample Data (Faker), you can adjust the number of records you want returned in your <code>Users</code>data, and optionally adjust additional configuration settings. You can always refer to your source's provided setup guide for specific instructions on filling out each field.</p><div><div>info</div><p>Some sources will have an <strong>Optional Fields</strong>tab. You can open this tab to view and configure any additional optional parameters that exist for the souce, but you do not have to do so to successfully set up the connector.</p></div><p>Once you've filled out all the required fields, click on the <strong>Set up source</strong>button and Airbyte will run a check to verify the connection. Happy replicating!</p><p>Can't find the connectors that you want?

For troubleshooting, see <a>here</a>.</p><p>Click <strong>Connect</strong>to save these settings.</p><p>Now that the connection to Snowflake has been created, you are good to go to explore your Snowflake data in Looker.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>Once you've set up and launched this initial integration, the real power lies in its adaptability and extensibility. Here’s a roadmap to help you customize and harness this project tailored to your specific data needs:</p><h3><strong>Create dbt Sources for Airbyte Data</strong>:</h3><p>Your raw data extracted via Airbyte can be represented as sources in dbt. Start by <a>creating new dbt sources</a>to represent this data, allowing for structured transformations down the line.</p><h3><strong>Add Your dbt Transformations</strong>:</h3><p>With your dbt sources in place, you can now build upon them. Add your custom SQL transformations in dbt, ensuring that you treat the sources as an upstream dependency. This ensures that your transformations work on the most up-to-date raw data.</p><h3><strong>Execute the Pipeline in Dagster</strong>:</h3><p>Navigate to the Dagster UI and click on "Materialize all". This triggers the entire pipeline, encompassing the extraction via Airbyte, transformations via dbt, and any other subsequent steps.</p><h3><strong>Explore in Looker</strong>:</h3><p>You can use the SQL Runner to create queries and Explores, create and share Looks (reports and dashboards), or use LookML to create a data model that Looker will use to query your data. However way you wish to go with your Snowflake data, the choice is yours.</p><h3><strong>Extend the Project</strong>:</h3><p>The real beauty of this integration is its extensibility. Whether you want to add more data sources, integrate additional tools, or enhance your transformation logic – the floor is yours. With the foundation set,
