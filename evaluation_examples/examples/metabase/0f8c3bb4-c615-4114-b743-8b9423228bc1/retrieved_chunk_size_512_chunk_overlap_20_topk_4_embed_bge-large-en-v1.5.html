You’ll see a list of all the people in your organization.</p><img/><h2>Creating an account</h2><p>To add a new person, click <strong>Invite someone</strong>in the upper right corner. You’ll be prompted to enter their email, and optionally their first and last names–only the email is required.</p><p>Click <strong>Create</strong>to activate an account. An account becomes active once you click <strong>Create</strong>, even if the person never signs into the account. The account remains active until you <a>deactivate the account</a>. If you’re on a paid Metabase plan, all active accounts will count toward your user account total. If one person has more than one account, each account will count toward the total (see <a>how billing works</a>).</p><p>If you’ve already <a>configured Metabase to use email</a>, Metabase will send the person an email inviting them to log into Metabase.
