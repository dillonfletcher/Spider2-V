In this task, we hope to backup the Metabase database file to a specific location. To achieve this goal:

1. Navigate to Desktop directory where locates the Metabase JAR.
2. Since the Metabase is running, you should first stop the Metabase process. You can either close the terminal or kill the process with CTRL-C. 
3. Copy the application database file (called `metabase.db.mv.db`) and keep that copy to the target directory, which means, creat the directory `/home/user/Metabase`, cd into it, paste the database file there.
4. Navigate back to Desktop directory. Restart Metabase: `java -jar metabase.jar`.
