The advantage of using the query builder is that Metabase will be able to fill out some of the metadata for you; if you use SQL, you’ll have to fill out that metadata manually.</li><li>Select your data.</li><li>Create and save your query.</li></ol><h3>Create a model from a saved question</h3><ol><li><a>Ask a question</a>using either the query builder or the SQL editor, or select an existing saved question that you want to convert to a model.</li><li>Save the question.</li><li>Click on the <strong>…</strong>&gt; <strong>Turn this into a model</strong>.</li></ol><img/><h2>Model detail page</h2><p>To view a model’s detail page:</p><ul><li>From a collection: click on the <strong>book</strong>icon next to a model.</li><li>From a model: click on the <strong>info</strong>button in the upper right, then click <strong>Model details</strong>.</li></ul><img/><p>Here you’ll see several tabs:</p><ul><li><strong>Used by</strong>: lists the items based on the model.</li><li><strong>Schema</strong>: lists the fields in the model.</li><li><strong>Actions</strong>: lists the actions in the model, and allows you to create new <a>actions</a>.</li></ul><p>The model detail page also shows some basic info about the model:</p><ul><li>Description</li><li>Contact (who wrote the model)</li><li>Backing table(s)</li></ul><p>To start a new question based on the model, click <strong>Explore</strong>.</p><p>To edit the model’s underlying query, click <strong>Edit definition</strong>.</p><p>You can also edit the model’s metadata.</p><h2>Add metadata to columns in a model</h2><p>Metadata is the secret sauce of models. When you write a SQL query, Metabase can display the results, but it can’t “know” what kind of data it’s returning (like it can with questions built using the query builder).

Plus, people who don’t know SQL can duplicate your question and use it as a starting point for another question.</p><img/><p>Query builder questions automatically get a drill-through menu applied to their visualizations, allowing people to click on a table or chart to <a>drill through the data</a>.</p><img/><p>Questions asked with the query builder can start with a <a>model</a>, a raw table, or with the results of a saved question, and you can convert them to native SQL at any time.</p><h4>Native queries</h4><p>Use the <strong>native query editor</strong>to compose questions in the database’s native query languages (typically SQL for relational databases, but also other query languages for data sources like MongoDB). For questions written in SQL, you can use variables in your code to create <a>SQL templates</a>, including <a>field filter</a>variables that can create smart dropdown filters.</p><img/><p>Like query builder questions, you can use the results of models or <a>saved questions</a>as starting points for new questions, just as you would a table or view. For example, to reference question 123 like so:</p><code><span>WITH</span><span>gizmo_orders</span><span>AS</span><span>#</span><span>{</span><span>123</span><span>}</span></code><h3>Create models to use as starting data for new questions</h3><p><a>Models</a>are built with questions from either the query builder or the SQL editor. You can use them to pull together data from multiple tables, with custom, calculated columns, and column descriptions and other metadata, to create great starting data for people to ask new questions. For example, you could build a model for “Active users”, or “Priority orders”, or however you want to model your business.</p><p>If you find that you’re using the same saved question over and over as your starting data for new questions, you may want to convert that saved question to a model, which will let you add metadata like column descriptions and column types.

Referencing models and saved questions

but people are most interested in a subset of that data. We can perform a complicated query once to return those results, and save that question as a model, which people can refer to in their queries just like they would with any other table.</p><h2>Search for models and questions as you type</h2><p>First, create and save a question or model that returns the result set you’d like to make available for people to query.</p><p>To reference that question or model in a SQL query, use typeahead search in a variable prefixed with <code>#</code>.</p><p>Type <code>{{#your search term }} </code>and Metabase will display a list of models and questions relevant to your search term.</p><img/><p>You can also find the question or model ID by navigating in Metabase to the model or question you’d like to reference in your query. The ID is in the URL in your browser’s address bar. The ID will be the number after <code>/model/</code>or <code>/question/</code>. E.g., for <code>https://metabase.example.com/model/12345-example-name</code>, the model’s ID would be <code>12345</code>.</p><p>Only the <code>#</code>and <code>ID</code>is required. Metabase just displays the model or question name to make the query more readable.</p><h2>Model, table, or saved question as a Common Table Expression (CTE)</h2><p>The same syntax can be used in <a>Common Table Expressions (CTEs)</a>(with SQL databases that support CTEs):</p><code>WITH gizmo_orders AS {{#5-gizmo-orders-in-2019}}
SELECT count(*)
FROM gizmo_orders
</code><p>When this query is run, the <code>{{#5-gizmo-orders-in-2019}}</code>tag will be substituted with the SQL query of the referenced question, surrounded by parentheses.
