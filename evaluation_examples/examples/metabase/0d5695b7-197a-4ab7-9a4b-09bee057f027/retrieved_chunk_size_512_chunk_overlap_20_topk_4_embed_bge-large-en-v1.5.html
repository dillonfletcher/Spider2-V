Plus, people who don’t know SQL can duplicate your question and use it as a starting point for another question.</p><img/><p>Query builder questions automatically get a drill-through menu applied to their visualizations, allowing people to click on a table or chart to <a>drill through the data</a>.</p><img/><p>Questions asked with the query builder can start with a <a>model</a>, a raw table, or with the results of a saved question, and you can convert them to native SQL at any time.</p><h4>Native queries</h4><p>Use the <strong>native query editor</strong>to compose questions in the database’s native query languages (typically SQL for relational databases, but also other query languages for data sources like MongoDB). For questions written in SQL, you can use variables in your code to create <a>SQL templates</a>, including <a>field filter</a>variables that can create smart dropdown filters.</p><img/><p>Like query builder questions, you can use the results of models or <a>saved questions</a>as starting points for new questions, just as you would a table or view. For example, to reference question 123 like so:</p><code><span>WITH</span><span>gizmo_orders</span><span>AS</span><span>#</span><span>{</span><span>123</span><span>}</span></code><h3>Create models to use as starting data for new questions</h3><p><a>Models</a>are built with questions from either the query builder or the SQL editor. You can use them to pull together data from multiple tables, with custom, calculated columns, and column descriptions and other metadata, to create great starting data for people to ask new questions. For example, you could build a model for “Active users”, or “Priority orders”, or however you want to model your business.</p><p>If you find that you’re using the same saved question over and over as your starting data for new questions, you may want to convert that saved question to a model, which will let you add metadata like column descriptions and column types.

The SQL editor

Documentation Content:
Click the blue <strong>Run query</strong>button to execute your query.</p><p>You’ll notice that the table that comes back is the same as if you had used the <a>query builder</a>to ask for the sum of <code>Subtotal</code>in the <code>Orders</code>table, grouped by the <code>Created At</code>date.</p><h3>Running query selections</h3><p>You can run your SQL query by pressing <strong>ctrl + enter</strong>on Windows and Linux, or <strong>⌘ + return</strong>on a Mac. You can also run only part of a query by highlighting the part you’d like to run before clicking the run button or using the run shortcut key.</p><p>Questions asked using SQL can be saved, downloaded, converted to models, and added to dashboards just like questions asked using the query builder.</p><p>You can also <a>refer to models and saved questions</a>in your SQL queries.</p><h2>Using SQL filters</h2><p>If you or someone else wrote a SQL query that includes <a>variables</a>, that question might have filter widgets at the top of the screen above the editor. Filter widgets let you modify the SQL query before it’s run, changing the results you might get.</p><img/><p>Writing SQL queries that use variables or parameters can be very powerful, but it’s also a bit more advanced, so that topic has its own page if you’d like to <a>learn more</a>.</p><h2>SQL snippets</h2><p>You can use <a>SQL snippets</a>to save, reuse, and share SQL code across multiple questions that are composed using the SQL editor.</p><h2>How Metabase executes SQL queries</h2><p>When you run a query from the SQL editor, Metabase sends the query to your database exactly as it is written. Any results or errors displayed in Metabase are the same as the results or errors that you would get if you ran the query directly against your database.

</a><a>Questions</a></ol><article><h1>Asking questions</h1><p>Metabase’s two core concepts are questions and their corresponding answers. To ask a question in Metabase, click the <strong>+ New</strong>button in the upper right of the main navigation bar, and select either:</p><ul><li>Question</li><a>SQL query</a></ul><p>This page covers how to ask a question using Metabase’s graphical query builder, the “Question” option.</p><h2>Creating a new question with the query builder</h2><p>From the <strong>+ New</strong>dropdown, select <strong>Question</strong>, then pick your starting data:</p><p>You can start a question from:</p><ul><li><strong>A model</strong>. A <a>model</a>is a special kind of saved question meant to be used as a good starting point for questions. Sometimes these are called derived tables, as they usually pull together data from multiple raw tables.</li><li><strong>Raw data</strong>. You’ll need to specify the database and the table in that database as the starting point for your question.</li><li>A <strong>saved question</strong>. You can use the results of any question as the starting point for a new question.</li></ul><p>Note that there are some kinds of saved questions that can’t be used as source data:</p><ul><li>Druid questions</li><li>Mongo questions</li><li>Questions that use <code>Cumulative Sum</code>or <code>Cumulative Count</code>aggregations</li><li>Questions that have columns that are named the same or similar thing, like <code>Count</code>and <code>Count 2</code></li></ul><h2>The query builder</h2><p>Once you select your data, Metabase will take you to the query builder. Say you selected <strong>Raw data</strong>&gt; <strong>Sample database</strong>&gt; <strong>Orders</strong>, then you’ll see something like this:</p><img/><p>This is the query builder’s notebook editor.
