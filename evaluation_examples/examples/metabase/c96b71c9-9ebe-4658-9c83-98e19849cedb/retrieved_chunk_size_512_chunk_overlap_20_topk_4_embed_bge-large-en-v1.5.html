Documentation Title:
Getting started with Metabase

Documentation Content:
Let’s say we want to know:</p><em>How many orders have been placed with a subtotal (before tax) greater than $40?</em><p>More precisely, this question translates to: “How many records (or rows) are in the <code>Orders</code>table that have a value greater than 40 in the <code>Subtotal</code>column?”</p><p>To find out, we want to filter the data by the field we’re interested in, which in this case is the <code>Subtotal</code>. Then we want to count the filtered rows.</p><img/><p>In the <strong>Filter</strong>step, we’ll click the purple <strong>Add filters to narrow your answer</strong>button, and we’ll select <code>Subtotal</code>as the column to filter on. In the dropdown menu, change “Equal to” to “Greater than”, enter 40 in the input field, then click <strong>Add filter</strong>.</p><h2>Previewing results</h2><p>With each step, you can click on the triangle on the right to preview the results so far.</p><img/><p>As expected, all of the subtotals are over $40 after the filter has been applied.</p><p>To close the preview, you can click on the <strong>X</strong>in the upper right of the preview.</p><h2>Summarizing data</h2><p>When we ask things like “how many,” “what’s the total,” “what’s the average,” etc., we’re talking about summarizing our data. That is, we’re talking about <a>metrics</a>. The metric in this case the number (or count) of orders after we’ve filtered for orders greater than $40. We’ll click the <strong>Pick the metric you want to see</strong>button in the <strong>Summarize</strong>step and select <strong>Count of rows</strong>.</p><p>When we click <strong>Visualize</strong>, Metabase will show us that there were 16,309 orders with a subtotal greater than $40.

Create filter widgets for charts using SQL variables

Documentation Content:
If you <em>don’t</em>provide a default, Metabase won’t execute the query until a value is supplied.</li></ul><p>In the case of <code>subtotal_var</code>, we want to:</p><ul><li>Set the <code>Variable type</code>to be <code>Number</code>(since we’re dealing with subtotals).</li><li>Change the <code>Filter widget label</code>from <code>subtotal_var</code>to <code>Subtotal</code>(just to make it easier to read).</li><li>Toggle <code>Required?</code>to be true.</li><li>Set the <code>Default filter widget value</code>to <code>0</code>. That way, when a question runs, it will return all results automatically; people can enter a higher subtotal if they wish to filter the results.</li></ul><p>Now we’re ready to plug in values into our Subtotal widget, and filter for orders with Subtotals greater than that value:</p><img/><h3>Making a basic input variable optional</h3><p>If we want to make the filter widget optional, we can enclose the <code>WHERE</code>clause in double brackets:</p><code><span>SELECT</span><span>*</span><span>FROM</span><span>orders</span><span>[[</span><span>WHERE</span><span>subtotal</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{{</span><span>subtotal_var</span><span>}}]]</span></code><p>With the <code>WHERE</code>clause in brackets, if the viewer does not enter a subtotal, and no default is set, the query would simply return all records from the <code>Orders</code>table (i.e., Metabase would only run <code>SELECT * FROM orders</code>).</p><h3>Adding multiple filters</h3><p>We can use multiple filters as well.

Documentation Title:
Simplify complex queries with Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Documentation Content:
We’d like to see a list of all orders with a <code>total</code>that’s greater than the average order’s total.</p><code><span>SELECT</span><span>id</span><span>,</span><span>total</span><span>FROM</span><span>orders</span><span>WHERE</span><span>-- filter for orders with above-average totals</span><span>total</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>SELECT</span><span>AVG</span><span>(</span><span>total</span><span>)</span><span>FROM</span><span>orders</span><span>)</span></code><p>This query gives us:</p><code>|ID  |TOTAL  |
|----|-------|
|2   |117.03 |
|4   |115.22 |
|5   |134.91 |
|... |...    |
</code><p>It seems simple enough: we have a subquery, <code>SELECT AVG(total) FROM orders</code>, nested in the <code>WHERE</code>clause that calculates the average order total. But what if grabbing the average were more involved?

<ul><li>For <strong>subqueries</strong>or <strong>CTEs</strong>, <a>run each <code>SELECT</code>block separately</a>and use the<code>LIMIT</code>clause.</li><li>For <strong>saved questions or models</strong>, go to the underlying Metabase question from the variables panel or by pasting the ID number into the search bar. Add a row limit using the query builder, or add a <code>LIMIT</code>clause in the SQL editor.</li></ul></li><li>Compare the column names and values between your samples to check for foreign keys. For example:
    <ul><li>In the <a>Metabase Sample Database</a>, the <code>Products</code>table has an <code>ID</code>column, and the <code>Orders</code>table has a <code>Product ID</code>column.</li><li><code>ID</code>and <code>Product ID</code>both contain integer values, and many of those values show up in both columns.</li></ul></li><li>Compare the rows between your samples to check for <a>table relationships</a>. For example:
    <ul><li>The <code>Products</code>table has unique values in the <code>ID</code>column.</li><li>The <code>Orders</code>table has multiple rows with the same <code>Product ID</code>.</li><li>The table relationship from <code>Products</code>to <code>Orders</code>is <a>one-to-many</a>(assuming that the foreign key relationship is valid).</li></ul></li><li>If you’re using a <a>model</a>, you can look for explicitly defined metadata by hovering over the column name.</li><li>If you’re building off of someone else’s work, ask the original creator of the query, saved question, or model.</li></ol><strong>Explanation</strong><p>A schema describes the columns in a table, the data types of those columns, and the relationships between columns across different tables.
