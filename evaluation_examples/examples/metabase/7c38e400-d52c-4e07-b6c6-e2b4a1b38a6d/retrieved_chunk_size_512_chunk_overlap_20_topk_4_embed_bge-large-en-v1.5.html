Documentation Title:
Running the Metabase JAR file

Documentation Content:
see <a>Activating your Metabase commercial license</a>.</p><h2>Quick start</h2><p>The quick start is intended for running Metabase locally. See below for instructions on <a>running Metabase in production</a>.</p><p>If you have Java installed:</p><ol><li><a>Download the JAR file for Metabase OSS</a>. If you’re on a <a>Pro</a>or <a>Enterprise</a>plan, download the <a>JAR for the Enterprise Edition</a>.</li><li>Create a new directory and move the Metabase JAR into it.</li><li>Change into your new Metabase directory and run the JAR.</li></ol><code>java -jar metabase.jar
</code><p>Metabase will log its progress in the terminal as it starts up. Wait until you see “Metabase Initialization Complete” and visit <code>http://localhost:3000/setup</code>.</p><p>If you are using a paid version, be sure to <a>activate your license</a>.</p><h2>Local installation</h2><p>If you just want to try Metabase out, play around with Metabase, or just use Metabase on your local machine, Metabase ships with a default application database that you can use. <strong>This setup is not meant for production</strong>. If you intend to run Metabase for real at your organization, see <a>Production installation</a>.</p><p>The below instructions are the same as the quick start above, just with a little more context around each step.</p><h3>1. Install Java JRE</h3><p>You may already have Java installed. To check the version, open a terminal and run:</p><code>java -version
</code><p>If Java isn’t installed, you’ll need to install Java before you can run Metabase. We recommend version 11 of JRE from <a>Eclipse Temurin</a>with HotSpot JVM. You can run Metabase wherever Java 11 runs.

Documentation Title:
Running Metabase on Debian as a service with nginx

Documentation Content:
So, a Metabase service should live at <code>/etc/systemd/system/metabase.service</code>.</p><h3>The Metabase service file</h3><p>Create the <code>/etc/systemd/system/metabase.service</code>service file and open it in your editor:</p><code>sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/metabase.service
sudo &lt;your-editor&gt; /etc/systemd/system/metabase.service
</code><p>In <code>/etc/systemd/system/metabase.service</code>, replace configurable items (they look like <code>&lt;some-var-name&gt;</code>) with values sensible for your system. The Metabase script below has extra comments to help you know what everything is for.</p><code>[Unit]
Description=Metabase server
After=syslog.target
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=&lt;/your/path/to/metabase/directory/&gt;
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar &lt;/your/path/to/metabase/directory/&gt;metabase.jar
EnvironmentFile=/etc/default/metabase
User=metabase
Type=simple
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=metabase
SuccessExitStatus=143
TimeoutStopSec=120
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code><h2>Create syslog conf</h2><p>Next we need to create a syslog conf to make sure systemd can handle the logs properly.</p><code>sudo touch /etc/rsyslog.d/metabase.conf
sudo &lt;your-editor&gt; /etc/rsyslog.d/metabase.conf

if $programname == 'metabase' then /var/log/metabase.log
&amp; stop
</code><p>Restart the syslog service to load the new config.</p><code>sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.service
</code><h2>Environment variables for Metabase</h2><p><a>Environment variables</a>provide a good way to customize and configure your Metabase instance on your server.
