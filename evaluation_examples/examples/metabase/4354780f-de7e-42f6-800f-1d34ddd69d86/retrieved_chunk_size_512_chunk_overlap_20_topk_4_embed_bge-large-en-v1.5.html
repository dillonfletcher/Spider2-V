Typically they’re used to show how many people make it through a particular sequence, such as a checkout flow on a website. The first step (or gate) would be how many people visited your site. Then how many people viewed a product page (step 2), how many added that item to their cart (step 3), and so on.</p><p>We’ll walk through how to build a funnel chart in Metabase using the Sample Database included with your installation so you can follow along. We’ll show examples both in the query builder and the sql editor:</p><ul><a>Query builder</a><a>SQl editor</a></ul><p>The Sample Database doesn’t contain events; it’s just four tables with order, product, and customer information. So we’ll have to get a little creative here to come up with examples for funnel charts.</p><h2>Funnel chart example using the query builder</h2><p>Here’s a contrived example. We’re going to pretend that the steps in our funnel are product categories (because we don’t have anything like statuses or pages or other progressions in our Sample Database). Here’s the <a>notebook view</a>of our query:</p><img/><p>What we’ve done is joined the <code>Orders</code>and <code>Products</code>tables (see <a>Joins in Metabase</a>), summarized the count of orders, and grouped those counts by product category. Then we’ve sorted the results by count, descending. To get a funnel chart, we clicked on <strong>Visualization</strong>in the bottom left, and selected <strong>Funnel</strong>.

Funnel charts

Documentation Content:
In the settings of a funnel chart, under the <strong>Data</strong>tab, you can set the <strong>Step</strong>(in this case we’re using the product category) and the <strong>Measure</strong>(the count of orders).</p><img/><p>Notice that in the <strong>Settings -&gt; Display</strong>tab, you can change the <strong>Funnel type</strong>to “Bar chart”, which is another valid way of representing the data. The advantage of a funnel chart (beyond the visual metaphor) is that Metabase will also show the percentage of the measure that made it through each step.</p><h3>Keeping the steps sorted with a custom column</h3><p>If the count in each step doesn’t naturally decrease, you may need to sort the steps manually to preserve the actual progression of steps. For example, if you have the same count in successive steps, the steps could get swapped in the funnel chart, like if Metabase defaults to sorting the steps alphabetically to break the tie. Likewise if you have funnels that can expand in count at certain steps (new people entering the funnel halfway through, for example) the funnel will default to descending counts, which will mess up your step order.</p><p>In these cases, you can create an additional column to number the steps, and sort by step to enforce the correct funnel sequence.

how many dollars they’ve spent on your products.</p><img/><h2>Pie chart or donut charts</h2><p>A <a>pie chart or donut chart</a>can be used when breaking out a metric by a single dimension, especially when the number of possible breakouts is small, like users by gender.</p><img/><h2>Funnel charts</h2><p><a>Funnels</a>are commonly used in e-commerce or sales to visualize how many customers are present within each step of a checkout flow or sales cycle. At their most general, funnels show you values broken out by steps, and the percent decrease between each successive step.</p><img/><h2>Maps</h2><p>When you select the <a>Map</a>visualization, Metabase will automatically try and pick the best kind of map to use based on the table or result set.</p><img/><h2>Formatting data in charts</h2><p>While we’re talking about formatting, we thought you should also know that you can access formatting options for the columns used in a chart. Just open the visualization settings and select the <code>Data</code>tab:</p><img/><p>Then click on the gear icon next to the column that you want to format. Dates, numbers, and currencies tend to have the most useful formatting options.</p><img/><h2>Further reading</h2><ul><a>Charts with multiple series</a><a>Appearance</a><a>BI dashboard best practices</a></ul></article><p>Read docs for other <a>versions of Metabase</a>.
