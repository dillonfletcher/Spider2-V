how many dollars they’ve spent on your products.</p><img/><h2>Pie chart or donut charts</h2><p>A <a>pie chart or donut chart</a>can be used when breaking out a metric by a single dimension, especially when the number of possible breakouts is small, like users by gender.</p><img/><h2>Funnel charts</h2><p><a>Funnels</a>are commonly used in e-commerce or sales to visualize how many customers are present within each step of a checkout flow or sales cycle. At their most general, funnels show you values broken out by steps, and the percent decrease between each successive step.</p><img/><h2>Maps</h2><p>When you select the <a>Map</a>visualization, Metabase will automatically try and pick the best kind of map to use based on the table or result set.</p><img/><h2>Formatting data in charts</h2><p>While we’re talking about formatting, we thought you should also know that you can access formatting options for the columns used in a chart. Just open the visualization settings and select the <code>Data</code>tab:</p><img/><p>Then click on the gear icon next to the column that you want to format. Dates, numbers, and currencies tend to have the most useful formatting options.</p><img/><h2>Further reading</h2><ul><a>Charts with multiple series</a><a>Appearance</a><a>BI dashboard best practices</a></ul></article><p>Read docs for other <a>versions of Metabase</a>.

Documentation Title:
BI dashboard best practices

Documentation Content:
You can use text cards as spacers, or as section titles or description and commentary.</p><h3>Look for opportunities to add more useful information</h3><p>Metabase’s visualizations take care of a lot of the best practices for information design and visual literacy—they do their best to make <a>Edward Tufte</a>proud, communicating maximum info with minimal “ink.” But even though Metabase charts come junk-free out of the box, you should review the visualization settings to see if you can add additional context. For example, there’s a lot you can do with the a <a>bar chart</a>. A simple goal line on a bar or line chart, or conditional formatting on a table, can provide meaningful answers to questions like: are these values good? Expected? On target?</p><img/><p>For instance, instead of simply displaying a number, you could additionally show how it’s gone up or down over time. Let’s say you want to include the number of orders for the last week; instead of displaying that as a plain number, you could instead group it by a time dimension and set the visualization to a <strong>trend line</strong>. That way people will get to see the value in the context of the previous number—did the value improve or worsen?</p><img/><p>You can also adjust the color of the trend arrow (green for good, red for bad), so numbers that you want to go down (like churn) and numbers that you’d like to go up (revenue) can both get green arrows.</p><h3>Pick the right visualizations for the job</h3><p>In general the best advice is to avoid mistaking a good looking, colorful dashboard for one that’s informative. A lot of BI articles (and we’re guilty of this at times as well) will display dashboards that showcase multiple different visualizations types: bar charts, gauges, pie charts, scatter plots, and so on. We do this because 1) they look cool, and 2) our goal is to demonstrate what the product can do, which is different than the goal of getting feedback on your decisions.
