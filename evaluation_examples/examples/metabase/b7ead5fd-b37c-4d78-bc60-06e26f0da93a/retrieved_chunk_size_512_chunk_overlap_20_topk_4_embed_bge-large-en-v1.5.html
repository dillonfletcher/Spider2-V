</a><a>People and Groups</a></ol><article><h1>Account settings</h1><p>You can view your account settings by going to the top right of the screen and clicking on the <strong>gear</strong>icon &gt; <strong>Account settings</strong>.</p><h2>Account profile</h2><p>You can set your first and last names, change your email address, and set your language. See our list of <a>supported languages</a>.</p><h2>Account password</h2><p>You can change your password here. Note that if your Metabase uses Single Sign-On (SSO), your administrator will have disabled this password section, as your identity provider will manage logins.</p><p>If you’re having trouble logging in, see our <a>People can’t log into Metabase</a>.</p><h2>Account login history</h2><p>The login history lists each login, along with some location information (if available), and some client information (like Browser (Firefox/Windows)).
If you see any suspicious login attempts, change your password and notify your administrator.</p><h3>A note about new login emails</h3><p>Whenever you log in from a new device, Metabase will send you an email just to let you know someone (presumably you) has logged in from an unrecognized device. If you see this email, but don’t remember logging in, or don’t recognize the device, change your password and let your administrator know.</p><h2>Disable animations in Metabase</h2><p>This isn’t an in-Metabase setting, but just so you know: you can disable UI animations in Metabase (like sidebars sliding around, or rotating spinners) by changing the settings for your operating system so it respects the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>CSS media feature. This change will also affect other applications, not just Metabase.

Managing people and groups

Documentation Content:
If you haven’t yet configured your email settings, they will see a message telling them to ask an admin to reset their password for them.</p><p>To reset a password for someone, just click the three dots icon next to their account and choose <strong>Reset Password</strong>. If you haven’t <a>configured your email settings</a>yet, you’ll be given a temporary password that you’ll have to share with that person. Otherwise, they’ll receive a password reset email.</p><h2>Resetting the admin password</h2><p>If you’re using Metabase Cloud, <a>contact support</a>to reset your admin password.</p><p>If you’re a Metabase admin and have access to the server console, you can get Metabase to send you a password reset token:</p><ol><li>Stop the running Metabase application.</li><li>Restart Metabase with <code>reset-password email@example.com</code>, where “email@example.com” is the email associated with the admin account:
    <code>java -jar metabase.jar reset-password email@example.com
</code></li><li><p>Metabase will print out a random token like this:</p><code>...
Resetting password for email@example.com...

OK [[[1_7db2b600-d538-4aeb-b4f7-0cf5b1970d89]]]
</code></li><li>Start Metabase normally again (<em>without</em>the <code>reset-password</code>option).</li><li>Navigate to it in your browser using the path <code>/auth/reset_password/:token</code>, where “:token” is the token that was generated from the step above.
