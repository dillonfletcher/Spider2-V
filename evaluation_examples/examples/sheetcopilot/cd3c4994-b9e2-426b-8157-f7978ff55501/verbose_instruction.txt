I would like to create a pivot table and a stacked column chart for my table. The steps to achieve this goal are:
1. Click the "Append sheet" on the left of "Sheet1" on the bottom (its icon is a sheet of paper with a "+" on the bottom-right). A new sheet with name "Sheet2" will be created.
2. Select cells A1:B1. Click "Merge Cells" on the toolbar.
3. Input "Summer sales ($)" in the merged cell.
4. Click "Sheet1" on the bottom to switch to "Sheet1".
5. Click "Insert" on the top menu bar. Select "Pivot Table..." in the dropdown menu.
6. Make sure the selection is "Current selection" and the entire sheet containing data is selected. Then click "OK" on the button-right of the pop-up window.
7. Drag "Month" from the available fields on the right to "Row Fields:" on the bottom-left of the pop-up window.
8. Drag "Sales Channel" from the available fields to "Column Fields:" in the upper middle.
9. Drag "Revenue" from the available fields to "Data Fields:" in the lower middle.
10. Click "Source and Destination" on the bottom to manually choose the destination.
11. Under "Destination", choose "Selection" from the options, and click the "Shrink" button on the right.
12. Click "Sheet2" on the bottom. Then select cell A2. You can see "$Sheet2.$A$2" in the textbox on the top.
13. Click "Expand" right of the textbox to return to the pop-up window. Click "OK" on the bottom-right. A pivot table will be generated in "Sheet2".
14. In "Sheet2", click "Insert" on the top menu bar. Select "Chart..." in the dropdown menu.
15. Click "Column" under "Choose a Chart Type". Choose the second graph "Stacked" of the three on the right. Then click "Next >" on the bottom of the pop-up window.
16. Input "Revenue of Each Channel ($)" in the textbox. Select the option "Bottom" under "Display legend" on the right.
17. Click "Finish" on the bottom-right of the pop-up window.
