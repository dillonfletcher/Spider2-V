I am using Astronomer to deploy Airflow. 
To create a new bucket called custom-xcom-backend in the MinIO Server and create a connection to my Astro project, we can follow the steps:
1. Add a new TAB to the Chrome;
2. Go to http://127.0.0.1:9000/
3. Log in with username ROOTNAME and password CHANGEME123;
4. Click "Access Keys" in the left menu;
5. Create a new Access Key and store it in a secure location;
6. Open a terminal;
7. Type "cd /home/user/projects";
8. Type "vim .env";
9. Add the following content to ".env"(change <your access key> and <your secret key> to the right information based on your Access Key creation process):
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=<your access key>
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=<your secret key>
MINIO_IP=host.docker.internal:9000
10. Save the file.
