I am using Astronomer to place Airflow
Read the README.md that has been opened in VSCode to get instructions on completing the DAG file
Complete the DAG file ‘task_today.py’ that has been opened in VSCode
        Fill the doc_md_doc with instruction
        Define the component doc_md_doc in the task field
At last, save it.
Find task_today in the DAG list on the Airflow web page and click the slider to the left of the name to Unpause dag
Click the triangle under the Action column on the far right to trigger dag
Wait for the status of all tasks in the Runs column to change to "success" or "failed"
