I am using Astronomer to deploy Airflow
To build a connection on Airflow and trigger the dag, we can follow the setps:
1. Click the VS Code editor on the left panel or dock
2. According to the opened README.md file, we can extract the basic information about the connection. 
3. Now, click the Chromium on the left panel to switch to the opened airflow web page.
4. Click the "Admin" button in the top menu bar of the web page;
5. Select "Connections" from the drop-down menu;
6. In the new page, click the blue button "+" below the search bar to create new Connection;
7. In the window "Add Connection", firstly set the category to "HTTP";
8. Next, type in values from config.yaml into the corresponding fields in the form:
   Connection id: http_weather_service, 
   Host: 'wttr.in', 
   Schema: 'https'
9. After filling these fields, click the button "Save" at the bottom of the web page;
10. Then, we will see a new line with name "http_weather_service" in the connection panel.
11. On the Airflow web page, find 'weather_data_dag' in the DAG list and click the slider to the left of the name to Unpause dag; 
12. Click the triangle under the Action column on the far right of the row to trigger the dag; 
13. Wait until the status of all tasks in the 'Runs' column to change to "success" or "failed".
