I am using Astronomer to place Airflow
Read the README.md that has been opened in VSCode to get error logging information to adjust the test_dag file
Adjust the DAG file ‘task_today.py’ that has been opened in VSCode
        Adjust according to the error logging information
At last, save it
Find task_today in the DAG list on the Airflow web page and click the slider to the left of the name to Unpause dag
Click the triangle under the Action column on the far right to trigger dag
Wait for the status of all tasks in the Runs column to change to "success" or "failed"
