Select Admin from the menu at the top of the Airflow web page
Click Connections
Click the blue plus sign below the Search bar to create a new Connection

Finally, at the bottom of the web page, click the dark blue Save button to save the Connection
After the Connection build is completed, read the README.md that has been opened in VSCode to get instructions on completing the DAG file
Complete the DAG file ‘SQL_Check.py’ that has been opened in VSCode
        To be specific 
        For SQLColumnCheckOperator, define task_id, conn_id, table with given variables and instructions
        Then, define partition_clause and column_mapping with given instructions to set conditions for checking 
        For SQLTableCheckOperator, define task_id, conn_id, table with given variables and instructions
        Then, define checks with given instructions to set conditions for checking 
At last, save it.
In the opened ‘/home/user/projects/SQL_Check’ terminal, enter ```astro dev restart`` to restart the UI
Find sql_data_quality in the DAG list on the Airflow web page and click the slider to the left of the name to Unpause dag
Click the triangle under the Action column on the far right to trigger dag
Wait for the status of all tasks in the Runs column to change to "success" or "failed"
Click sql_data_quality in the Dag column to enter the task details of the DAG
