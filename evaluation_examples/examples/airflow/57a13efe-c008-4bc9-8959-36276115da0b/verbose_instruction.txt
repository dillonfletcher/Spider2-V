I am using Astronomer to place Airflow
Find workFlow_Echo in the DAG list on the Airflow web page and click the slider to the left of the name to Unpause dag
Click the triangle under the Action column on the far right to trigger dag
Wait for the status of all tasks in the Runs column to change to "success" or "failed"
