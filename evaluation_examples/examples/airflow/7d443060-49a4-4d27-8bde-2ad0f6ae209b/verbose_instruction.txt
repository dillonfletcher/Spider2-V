I am using Astronomer to place Airflow
Read the README.md that has been opened in VSCode to get instructions on completing the test_dag file
Complete the DAG file ‘test_dag.py’ that has been opened in VSCode
        Define test_file_imports, test_dag_schedule_interval,test_task_workflow_order respectively following the instruction
        Use "assert" to define expected test result for the last two test functions
At last, save it.
Find task_today in the DAG list on the Airflow web page and click the slider to the left of the name to Unpause dag
Click the triangle under the Action column on the far right to trigger dag
Wait for the status of all tasks in the Runs column to change to "success" or "failed"
