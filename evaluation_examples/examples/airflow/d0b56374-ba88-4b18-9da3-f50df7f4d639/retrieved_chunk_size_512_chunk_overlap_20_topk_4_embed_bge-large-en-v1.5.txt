Then, open your project directory and run:
astro dev start
This command builds your project and spins up 6 Docker containers on your machine to run it:
The Airflow webserver, which runs the Airflow UI and can be accessed at
https://localhost:8080/
.
The Airflow scheduler, which is responsible for monitoring and triggering tasks.
The Airflow triggerer, which is an Airflow component used to run deferrable operators.
The Airflow metadata database, which is a Postgres database that runs on port
5432
.
A local

Data source
​
This example uses the
Possum Regression dataset
from Kaggle. It contains measurements of different attributes, such as total length, skull width, or age, for 104 possums. This data was originally published by Lindenmayer et al. (1995) in the Australian Journal of Zoology and is commonly used to teach linear regression.
Project overview
​
This project consists of three DAGs which have dependency relationships through
Airflow datasets
.
The
feature_eng
DAG prepares the MLflow experiment and builds prediction features from the possum data.
The
train
DAG trains a RidgeCV model on the engineered features from
feature_eng
and then registers the model with MLflow using operators from the
MLflow Airflow provider
.
The
predict
DAG uses the trained model from
train
to create predictions and plot them against the target values.
Note that the model is trained on the whole dataset and predictions are made on the same data. In a real world scenario you'd want to split the data into a training, validation, and test set.
Project code
​
This use case shows many Airflow features and ways to interact with MLflow. The following sections will highlight a couple of relevant code snippets in each DAG and explain them in more detail.

The ID number of the MLflow experiment is retrieved using the MLflowClientHook in the
fetch_experiment_id
task in order to track model training in the same experiment.
The
train_model
task, defined with the
@aql.dataframe
decorator, shows how model training can be parameterized when using Airflow. In this example, the hyperparameters, the
target_colum
, and the model class are hardcoded, but they could also be retrieved from upstream tasks via
XCom
or passed into manual runs of the DAG using
DAG params
.
The project is set up to train the
scikit-learn RidgeCV model
to predict the tail length of possums using information such as their age, total length, or skull width.

The predicted possum tail length values are converted to a dataframe and then plotted against the true tail lengths using matplotlib. The resulting graph offers a visual representation of how much variation of possum tail length can be explained by a linear regression model using the features in the dataset in this specific possum population of 104 animals.
Congratulations! You ran a ML pipeline tracking model parameters and versions in MLflow using the MLflow Airflow provider. You can now use this pipeline as a template for your own MLflow projects.

The

the scaler run in MLflow.
The task is defined using the

Model training DAG

datasets
let you schedule DAGs based on when a specific file or database is updated in a separate DAG. In this example, the model training DAG is scheduled to run as soon as the last task in the feature engineering DAG completes.
@dag
(
schedule

[
Dataset
(
"s3://"

The
fetch_feature_df
task pulls the feature dataframe that was pushed to
XCom
in the previous DAG.
