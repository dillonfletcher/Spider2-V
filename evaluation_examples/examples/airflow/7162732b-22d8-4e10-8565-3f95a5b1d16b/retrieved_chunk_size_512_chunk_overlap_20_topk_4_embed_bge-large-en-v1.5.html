This is not possible while the DAG is still running, and will not delete the Python file in which the DAG is defined, meaning the DAG will appear again in your UI with no history at the next parsing of the <code>/dags</code>folder from the scheduler.</p><p>The Python script below sends a DELETE request to a DAG with a specific ID (here: <code>dag_to_delete</code>).</p><code><span># import the request library</span><span><span>import</span><span>requests</span></span><span><span>import</span><span>os</span></span><span># provide the location of your airflow instance</span><span><span>ENDPOINT_URL </span><span>=</span><span>"http://localhost:8080/"</span></span><span># in this example env variables were used to store login information</span><span># you will need to provide your own credentials</span><span><span>user_name </span><span>=</span><span>os</span><span>.</span><span>environ</span><span>[</span><span>"USERNAME_AIRFLOW_INSTANCE"</span><span>]</span></span><span><span>password </span><span>=</span><span>os</span><span>.

View Deployment logs | Astronomer Documentation

Documentation Content:
This often includes deprecation notices marked as <code>DeprecationWarning</code>. For example, Airflow might recommend that you upgrade your Deployment if there was a change to the Airflow database or task execution logic.</li><li><strong>Info</strong>: Emitted frequently by Airflow to show that a standard scheduler process, such as DAG parsing, has started. These logs are frequent and can contain useful information. If you run dynamically generated DAGs, for example, these logs will show how many DAGs were created per DAG file and how long it took the scheduler to parse each of them.</li></ul><h3>View Airflow component logs in the Astro UI<a>​</a></h3><p>You can access scheduler, triggerer, and task logs in the Astro UI to find the past 24 hours of logs for any Deployment on its <strong>Logs</strong>page.</p><ol><p>In the Astro UI, select a Workspace and then a Deployment.</p><p>Click the <strong>Logs</strong>tab.</p></ol><p>The maximum number of lines returned is 10,000, with 50 results displayed per page. If there are no logs available for a given Deployment, the following message appears:</p><span>No matching events have been recorded in the past 24 hours.</span><p>Typically, this indicates that the Deployment you selected does not currently have any DAGs running.</p><h4>Filter options<a>​</a></h4><p>You can use the following options to specify the types of logs or messages that you want to view.</p><ul><p><strong>String search</strong>: Enter a string, keyword, or phrase to find in your logs. You can also search with suffix wildcards by adding a <code>*</code>to your search query. For example, <code>acti*</code>returns results that include <code>action</code>and <code>acting</code>.

It includes live metrics, such as currently occupied slots in different <a>pools</a>, unpaused DAGs, and scheduler health.
It also includes historical metrics like the states of past DAG runs and task instances, as well as how each DAG run was triggered.</p><img/><h2>Datasets tab<a>​</a></h2><p>The <strong>Dataset</strong>tab links to a page showing all datasets that have been produced in the Airflow environment, as well as all dependencies between datasets and DAGs in a graph.</p><img/><p>Click a dataset to open the history of all updates to the dataset that were recorded in the Airflow environment.
